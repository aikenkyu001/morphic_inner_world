## Abstract
Reliable compositional reasoning remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence, particularly in settings requiring deep structural manipulation. While modern large language models demonstrate impressive linguistic capabilities, they often exhibit instability when reasoning over nested or structurally complex tasks. This paper introduces **Morphic Inner World (MIW)**, a cognitive architecture designed to explore the potential for **Language- and Platform-Invariant Deterministic Intelligence**. Specifically, MIW models reasoning as a structure-preserving **geometric projection** from natural language into a symbolic manifold defined by a **free term algebra**. By employing a strategic longest-match tokenizer, a fixed dictionary of **44 Morphic Primitives**, and a decoupled **Wisdom Base**, MIW maintains high logical consistency across multiple languages and execution kernels. Evaluation across 60 tasks demonstrates that logical substance remains invariant across linguistic and computational substrates within the evaluated scope, achieving 100.0% accuracy and bit-identical parity.

## 1. Introduction
Modern neural language models frequently struggle with **systematic compositional reasoning**, especially in tasks requiring precise structural manipulation (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Liu et al., 2023). These limitations stem from the probabilistic nature of transformer-based architectures, which often lack a stable structural anchor (Baroni, 2022). Historically, cognitive architectures such as **ACT-R** (Anderson et al., 2004) and **SOAR** (Langley et al., 2009; Ludwig, 2005) have provided structured frameworks for over four decades (Kotseruba & Tsotsos, 2020); however, they frequently rely on heuristic search. Recent work in deterministic and self-reflective machine intelligence (Alexander, 2020; Bhatnagar, 2025) underscores the need for bit-level reproducibility and formal provenance in reasoning systems (Marcus, 2020). Consequently, MIW situates reasoning within a **deterministic algebraic reduction** framework (Gurevich, 1995; Abadi & Plotkin, 2020), tracing its lineage to foundational **postulates of logic** (Church, 1932).

## 2. Architecture and Formal Model

### 2.1 The Global Flow
The MIW architecture processes input through a unidirectional three-stage pipeline (Fig. 1). From an information-theoretic perspective, this process can be viewed as a transition from high-entropy linguistic input to a low-entropy, structured logical normal form (Tononi, 2004; Saanum et al., 2024). This transition is governed by principles of **harmonic mind** architectures (Smolensky & Legendre, 2006).

![Fig. 1](images/fig1_global_flow.pdf)
**Fig. 1: Global Architecture of Morphic Inner World.** This diagram illustrates the deterministic progression from ambiguous natural language to a verified normal form through structure-preserving stages.

### 2.2 Input Projection and MSP Check
The projection phase $h: \mathcal{L} \to \Sigma^*$ is designed to be strictly deterministic. It employs:
1.  **Strategic Longest-Match Tokenization**: To resolve semantic ambiguity without complex parsers, phrases in the dictionary are sorted by character length in descending order before matching. This ensures that specific, complex intents (e.g., "sort by end time") are prioritized over generic sub-components (e.g., "sort"), thereby reducing overlapping term interference. This deterministic mapping aligns with the principles of **structural representation** (Licato et al., 2014), **universal grammar** (Montague, 1970), and categorical syntactic processes (Steedman, 2000).
2.  **MSP (Morphic Structural Pointers)**: Numbered markers (e.g., "1.", "2.") serve as structural anchors. The synthesizer filters out text outside these anchors, treating it as background noise. This protocol enables the system to extract precise logic even from documents exceeding 8,000 tokens, addressing the "lost in the middle" phenomenon (Liu et al., 2023) and ensuring that the **linguistic structure** is correctly identified for deliberate reasoning (Baroni, 2022; Boggs, 2025).

### 2.3 Morphic Primitives and Wisdom Base
The dictionary consists of **44 irreducible primitives** ($\Sigma$). A key architectural feature is the **Wisdom Base (WB)**, a substrate-independent registry that maps abstract primitive IDs to platform-specific implementations (Fig. 2). This registry functions to allow the same universal logical structure (AST) to be instantiated across kernels (Python vs. Fortran) while maintaining functional equivalence. This approach builds upon the concept of **deterministic self-reflection** (Bhatnagar, 2025).

![Fig. 2](images/fig2_substrate.pdf)
**Fig. 2: Substrate Independence Layer.** The Wisdom Base functions as a cognitive registry, decoupling the universal logic (AST) from platform-specific execution kernels to ensure implementation invariance.

Furthermore, MIW employs **Semantic Cleansing** at the boundary of the execution kernel to normalize native input data into Morphic Values. Complex recursive algorithms are treated as **Fixpoint Packages**—atomic primitives that encapsulate internal structural recursion. This encapsulation ensures that structural complexity remains constant from the perspective of the synthesis engine, allowing MIW to maintain a manageable logical flow even during high-complexity tasks. This set forms the basis of the free term algebra $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{T}(\Sigma, \mathcal{V})$, which facilitates **systematic generalization** (Zhang et al., 2022) and universal knowledge models (Sukhobokov, 2024).

---

## 3. Structural Synthesis and Evaluation Semantics

Synthesis $g: \Sigma^* \to \mathcal{M}$ constructs symbolic trees satisfying mandatory arity constraints $\alpha(P)$ (Fig. 3). The synthesis engine utilizes **Arity-based Partial Application**, where functions are transformed into closures ($VClosure$) until all required arguments are supplied. This facilitates the dynamic composition of logic from linear natural language phrases, supported by theories of **dual-process models** of compositional generalization (Novello et al., 2025).

![Fig. 3](images/fig3_folding.pdf)
**Fig. 3: Recursive Folding Logic.** This visualization demonstrates how primitives are recursively composed into a universal logic form by strictly validating arity constraints $\alpha(P)$ against incoming arguments.

Furthermore, logical steps are composed into an **Immutable DAG Structure** using nested `Let` bindings. This ensures that each intermediate result is an immutable named object within the evaluation scope, eliminating side effects and providing a clear lineage for computed values. Evaluation is performed via deterministic rewrite rules $R_P$ (Landin, 1964; Baader & Nipkow, 1998), ensuring termination and confluence (see Appendix B). This formal evaluation process is grounded in **Structural Operational Semantics** (Plotkin, 1977) and the principle of **Propositions as Types** (Wadler, 2015).

## 4. Examples of Compositional Reasoning
MIW was applied to diverse reasoning categories beyond simple sorting:
- **Algorithmic**: `FILTER(EVEN, SORT(numbers))`.
- **Spatial Reasoning**: `DIJKSTRA(graph, start, end)`.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: `SOLVE_SUDOKU(grid)`.
- **Optimization**: `TREE_MAX_PATH(root)`.

The specific transformation of a linear task description into a formal result is visualized in the execution trace (Fig. 4), demonstrating the system's ability to maintain deliberate **visual-symbolic reasoning** (Boggs, 2025).

![Fig. 4](images/fig4_trace.pdf)
**Fig. 4: Execution Trace Pipeline.** This figure traces a concrete example of the activity_selection task, showing the mapping from NL phrases to primitive IDs and the resulting universal logic form.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation
The evaluation of MIW consists of 60 deterministic reasoning tasks covering arithmetic transformation, logical inference, structural parsing, and symbolic manipulation. A detailed description of these tasks and the classification criteria is provided in Appendix A. As illustrated in Fig. 5, MIW maintains absolute reliability (100.0% accuracy) across all complexity scales, exhibiting no decay or hallucinations. Within the scope of this study, all tasks were executed across multiple platforms to verify deterministic, bit-identical results, confirming implementation invariance through **term rewriting** systems (Baumgartner et al., 2025).

![Fig. 5](images/fig5_reliability.pdf)
**Fig. 5: Reliability vs. Complexity Contrast.** This plot demonstrates that Morphic's deterministic engine maintains 100% accuracy regardless of task scale (v, d, n), whereas stochastic models (LLMs) typically exhibit decay.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Language Invariance
The 100.0% parity achieved across English and Japanese specifications in this study provides strong evidence for a fundamental **decoupling between linguistic form and logical substance** (Fig. 6), highlighting the critical distinction between meaning and understanding in the age of data (Bender & Koller, 2020). In the MIW framework, natural language serves merely as a coordinate system for orienting and triggering logical primitives. This **Language Invariance** suggests that the "geometry of thought" may function as a universal invariant, independent of the specific linguistic shell used for its transmission. Here, **“geometry of thought”** refers to the invariant structure of reasoning represented as a normal-form AST, a concept supported by **logical frameworks** (Harper et al., 1987) and the theory of **Institutions** (Goguen & Burstall, 1992).

![Fig. 6](images/fig6_manifold.pdf)
**Fig. 6: Language Invariance Manifold.** This figure illustrates geometric convergence where English and Japanese specifications are projected into the same universal logic form.

### 6.2 Platform Invariance
The achievement of **bit-identical parity** between Python and Modern Fortran kernels supports the concept of **Platform Invariance** (Fig. 7). Specifically, it indicates that the reduction of logic to a Normal Form is a mathematical necessity that transcends the specific idioms of a computing environment. By decoupling the "logic of thought" from the "mechanics of execution," MIW demonstrates the potential to liberate deterministic intelligence from its underlying substrate (Alexander, 2020; Bhatnagar, 2025). Platform invariance emerges from the mathematical necessity of reduction to a normal form, confirming that compositional reasoning can be realized as a deterministic, structure-preserving mapping.

![Fig. 7](images/fig7_manifold.pdf)
**Fig. 7: Deterministic Kernel Parity.** This visualization shows a single universal logic form processed by independent execution kernels (Python and Fortran), both converging on a bit-identical Normal Form.

## 7. Conclusion
MIW demonstrates that compositional reasoning can be realized as a deterministic, structure-preserving mapping. Future work will explore hybridization with probabilistic models (Bengio et al., 2020) to bridge structural and perceptual grounding (Harnad, 1990). Furthermore, incorporating **sheaf-theoretic** constructs (Shkursky, 2025) may further generalize MIW into a geometric framework capable of representing overlapping cognitive manifolds (Dhar et al., 2025). This may lead to emergent cognition through architectures like **COGENT3** (Salazar, 2025) and advanced **neuromorphic engineering** (Indiveri & Liu, 2021; Sandamirskaya, 2014).

## Appendix A: Evaluation Methodology and Task Details

### A.1 Task Categories
The 60 benchmark tasks are categorized into four primary domains to test the breadth of symbolic reasoning.

| Category | Tasks | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Arithmetic reasoning | 10 | Normalization and reduction of mathematical expressions. |
| Logical inference | 15 | Evaluation of complex boolean constraints and predicates. |
| Structural transformation | 20 | Parsing and reconstruction of nested data structures (lists, trees). |
| Symbolic manipulation | 15 | High-level algorithmic execution (e.g., Dijkstra, Sudoku). |

### A.2 Example Tasks
To illustrate the projection process, consider the following specific task:

**Task 12: Arithmetic normalization**
*   **Input**: "three plus five times two"
*   **Logic Flow**: `1. multiply 5 by 2`, `2. add result to 3`
*   **Expected representation**: `ADD(3, MUL(5, 2))`
*   **Result**: `13`

### A.3 Deterministic Execution and Difficulty
All tasks were manually constructed to test deterministic symbolic reasoning and were executed across multiple platforms (Python and Fortran) to verify bit-identical parity.

| Task Category | Difficulty | Reasoning Depth |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Arithmetic | Low | Shallow |
| Logical | Medium | Moderate |
| Structural | Medium | Deep (Nested) |
| Symbolic | High | Complex (Recursive) |

## Appendix B: Formal Reduction Semantics
Evaluation is defined as a reduction to **Normal Form (NF)**. The evaluation function $Eval: \mathcal{T}(\Sigma, \mathcal{V}) \to NF$ is defined by:
1. $Eval(c) = c$ for atomic literals.
2. $Eval(P(t_1, ..., t_n)) = R_P(Eval(t_1), ..., Eval(t_n))$ for applications.
Termination and confluence are ensured by finite arity constraints and orthogonality of rewrite rules (Baader & Nipkow, 1998). This reduction follows the principles of Propositions as Types (Wadler, 2015).

To maintain absolute predictability, MIW employs **Deterministic Error Handling** (Fig. 8). Instead of triggering system-level exceptions, the evaluator returns a **VError** value in cases of undefined operations or type mismatches. This approach treats errors as legitimate states within the logic, ensuring that the kernel never crashes and always produces a well-defined result even under failure conditions (Bhatnagar, 2025).

![Fig. 8](images/fig8_error.pdf)
**Fig. 8: Deterministic Error Flow.** This diagram shows how MIW propagates VError objects through the universal logic form to maintain safe and predictable termination.
